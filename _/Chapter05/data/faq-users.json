    "internationalPhone": "Yes. For a small additional monthly subscription, we offer a range of telephone numbers from major international cities such as New York, Toronto, Amsterdam, Sydney and Dublin.",
    "transferNumber": "Yes, we’re happy to transfer an existing number to CircleLoop. We can port most landline numbers for £20+VAT. We also port in from all UK major networks free of charge. Please note that we can't port international numbers.",
    "portingTime": "It varies. Mobile numbers are really straightforward and take a couple of days. Other numbers can take anything from 7 to 20 days depending on the provider we are transferring from. The process is quite old-fashioned and very fussy. Unfortunately, it’s not something that we’re in control of, but we’ll always do our best to speed up the process for you.",
